Quake-4-Final-Project
=====================

Final Project Mod for Quake 4 for the class IT-266 - Patrick Musi

Deliverables include dodgeball-like weapon system, dodging ability, catching ability, and team play.

Dodgeball-like Weapon System:

  All other weapons have been removed except for the gauntlet and grenade launcher.  Each player can only hold one dodgeball
  at any given time.  The grenade launcher acts as the dodgeball weapon while the gauntlet acts as a bare hand for catching
  since it no longer deals damage.  The only way to score a kill is for a direct hit with a dodgeball, bounces off of walls
  or the floor do not count.  Another way to score a kill is to catch the dodgeball of another player before it hits
  something.
  
Dodging Ability:

  There is a new dodging ability bound to the "q" and "e" keys.  "q" is a left dodge and "e" is a right dodge.  The dodge
  ability causes the player to quickly move to their left or right in order to dodge an incoming dodgeball.
  
Catching Ability:

  The gauntlet acts as the catching ability.  Using the gauntlet on a dodgeball will causes the player to pick up that
  dodgeball if they do not currently have one.  Using standard dodgeball rules, if a dodgeball is caught in midair before
  it hits anything else, the thrower of the dodgeball is killed and the catcher scores a point.
  
Team Play:

  This deliverable has already been satisfied using the already included "Team Deathmatch" multiplayer mode.
